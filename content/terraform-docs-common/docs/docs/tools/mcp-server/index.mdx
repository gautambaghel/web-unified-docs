# Terraform MCP server overview

The Terraform Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enhances AI models with real-time access to current Terraform provider documentation, modules, and policies from the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io). This ensures AI-generated Terraform configurations use accurate, up-to-date information rather than potentially outdated training data.

## What is the Terraform MCP server?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to securely connect with external tools, applications, and data sources. MCP allows AI models to access information beyond their training data, providing more current and accurate responses.

The Terraform MCP server implements this protocol specifically for Terraform development, offering several key benefits:

- **Real-time accuracy**: Access current provider documentation instead of relying on potentially outdated training data
- **Registry integration**: Direct connection to the official [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io)
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Support for providers, modules, and Sentinel policies
- **AI enhancement**: Enables more accurate and actionable Terraform configuration generation

## How it works

When you connect an AI model to the Terraform MCP server, the model gains access to specialized tools that can perform the following actions:

1. Search and retrieve current provider documentation
1. Access module information, including inputs, outputs, and examples  
1. Find Sentinel policies for governance and compliance

The AI model uses these tools automatically when you ask questions about Terraform configuration, ensuring responses are based on the most current information available in the registry.

The server specifically handles registry-based information. For general Terraform questions or code generation requests not requiring registry data, AI models use their standard training data and other sources.

## Getting started workflow

Complete the following steps to set up the Terraform MCP server:

1. Choose your deployment option based on your environment:

    - Local development: Run in `stdio` mode on your workstation
    - Remote deployment: Run in `streamable-http` mode for network access
    - Installation options: Run in a Docker container, as a compiled binary, or install from source

1. [Deploy the server](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server/deploy)

1. Connect your AI client to the MCP server using the appropriate configuration for your chosen deployment method. 

After deploying the server, you can begin asking your AI model questions about Terraform configuration. The model automatically uses MCP server tools when it needs current registry information. Refer to [Prompt a model](/terraform/docs/tools/mcp-server/prompt) for effective prompting techniques.

## Available tools

The Terraform MCP server provides specialized tools that AI models can use to access current Terraform registry information. These tools work automatically when you ask relevant questionsâ€”you don't need to invoke them manually.

### Provider tools

Access comprehensive provider documentation for resources, data sources, functions, and configuration guides.

| Tool | Purpose | What it returns |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `search_providers` | Find provider documentation by service name | List of available documentation with IDs, titles, and categories |
| `get_provider_details` | Retrieve complete documentation for a specific provider component | Full documentation content in markdown format |

Example prompt: "How do I configure an AWS S3 bucket with versioning enabled?"

### Module tools

Discover and explore community and verified modules from the Terraform registry.

| Tool | Purpose | What it returns |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `search_modules` | Find modules by name or functionality | Module details including names, descriptions, download counts, and verification status |
| `get_module_details` | Get comprehensive module information | Complete documentation with inputs, outputs, examples, and submodules |

Example prompt: "Show me modules for deploying a Kubernetes cluster on AWS."

### Policy tools

Access Sentinel policies for governance and compliance requirements.

| Tool | Purpose | What it returns |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `search_policies` | Find Sentinel policies by topic or requirement | Policy listings with IDs, names, and download statistics |
| `get_policy_details` | Retrieve detailed policy documentation | Policy implementation details and usage instructions |

Example prompt: "What Sentinel policies are available for enforcing security best practices?"

## Available resources

The Terraform MCP server enables AI models to access official Terraform standards and documentation, ensuring generated code adheres closely to best practices and current guidelines.

### Terraform styling guides

| Resource | Purpose | What it returns |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `/terraform/style-guide` | Provide Terraform code style and formatting best practices | Guidelines for formatting, naming, and organizing Terraform code |
| `/terraform/module-development` | Provide Terraform module composition and structure guide | Guidelines for composing, structuring, refactoring and publishing Terraform modules |
